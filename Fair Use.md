DJ Earworm has been around for a couple of years, creating mixes and blends that capture the spirit of the summer using the yearly hits. The majority of his mash-ups are composed from the instrumental and vocal tracks of about 15 songs. Since he produces his songs under DJ Earworm, his songs can be defined as _pseudonymous works_ because they are phonorecords of which the author is identified under a fictitious name. 
The purpose of this is to analyze the  [DJ Earworm's Summer '16 Mashup](http://djearworm.com/Mashups.php) to prove that it should be considered Fair Use. Since all of the songs are released with a corresponding music video that uses the tidbits of the music videos produced for the songs in the mash-up, I think it is important to also explore the legality of those.  In order to fairly analyze this mashup, we will consider the same four factors that judges consider in judicial cases of Fair Use.



###**The four factors judges consider in cases of Fair Use are**:

* The purpose and character of its use
* The nature of the copyrighted work
* The amount and sustainability of the portion taken
* The effect of the use upon the potential market

##**Defense**

1. _The purpose and character of its use:_  
	As defined by the [17 U.S. Code](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/101), it can be considered a _collective work_. This Mashup is completely **transformative**. It takes video footage and lyrical work from 19 different songs and creates a new work with a blended melody. DJ Earworm's staple sound makes this mashup **original** and new. By combining several instrumental tracks with the vocals of other tracks, the mash-up is new and not just an imitation piece. The songs in the mash-up were created to serve as independent works. When they were  all put together, they became a  musical representation of the past year. The compilation exists to make several different parts into a whole. 
2. _The nature of the copyrighted work:_  
	The nineteen songs that compose this mash-up are published works by published artists. It is stated in the Fair Use act, that it is more likely to be considered not Fair Use if the works are unpublished. In no instance does DJ Earworm claim rights or ownership of these songs. As the biggest hits of the year, they are very well known and recognizable by the majority.
3. _The amount and substantiality of the portion taken:_  
	The snippets used in the Summer Mashup '16 are enough to be discernible, but not enough to misappropriate their identities. It can be argued that this mash-up is more Fair Use than others in the mashup/remix genre because of its use of more than ten songs. 
4. _The effect of the use upon the potential market:_  
	The 17 U.S. Code defines “financial gain” as inclusive of receipt, or expectation of receipt, of anything of value, including the receipt of other copyrighted works. Under that definition, DJ Earworm has no intention of making money from his music from the moment he begins creating it. Therefore his music is undoubtedly fair. In an interview with DJ Earworm, that can be found [here](http://www.digitaldjtips.com/2011/02/dj-earworm-interview-i-prefer-to-call-myself-a-data-jockey/), he says the songs provide no financial gain for him.  

>Interviewer: And if you don't mind me asking, how do you actually earn your income? I mean, I presume you can't make any money off the mash-ups themselves?  
>DJ Earworm: No, I don't sell my mash-ups - I don't get anything from sales. When I put stuff together it's more promotional.  

##**Summary**
| Factors | Justification |
|:-----   | :----: |
|The purpose and character of its use| Transformative |
|The nature of the copyrighted work| Created from published works |
|The amount and sustainability of the portion taken| Used small portions of 19 different songs/clips |
|The effect of the use upon the potential market | DJ Earworm makes no money from his work |
